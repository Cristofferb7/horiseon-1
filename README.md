# Horiseon-1

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## First Homework Description

This is a rework of a code that was already built but the class had to make it more semantic. Change a lot of extra code and extra lines that were not needed for the final product.

## Content 
- HTML: Fixed all the unnecessary div and made the code shorter and semantic friendly.
- CSS: Change the style in some areas and deleted extra lines.
